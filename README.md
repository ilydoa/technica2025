# Grocery Budgie

🦜 Welcome to Grocery Budgie, the grocery budgeting friend you never knew you needed!

As college students, we need to mindful when budgeting for our groceries. And when we're pressed for time, we can't go around comparing prices. Introducing Grocery Budgie, the app that learns from your past shopping trips and tells you where you'll get the best value based on your weekly groceries.

You will:
1) Upload your receipts from past shopping trips at different stores
2) Write out your weekly grocery list

🦜 Grocery Budgie will:
1) Use your past receipts to estimate where you'll get the best price for your needs of the week
2) Give you store recommendations
3) Recommend which items you should buy from each store
4) Dynamically update your grocery list as you scan in receipts

🦜 Happy shopping!
